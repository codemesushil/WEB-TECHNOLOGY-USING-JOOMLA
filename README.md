The main goal of a Furniture Gallery website is to sell goods and services online. Our project deals with developing a Shopping website for buying
Furniture online. In order to develop this number of technologies were studied and understood. These include server and client-side scripting techniques
and programming languages like PHP, JavaScript, HTML and the Relational Database (MySQL).
Our main motive was to create a website where the user can buy Furniture of his choice and the Sellers can add their new items for sale. We provide a
very wide range of Classic, Royal and many sophisticated designs of all the wooden, steel and many more compositions for all furniture items. Here all
the Customers can go through our blogs for any of the information and they can buy any item via their login portal.
